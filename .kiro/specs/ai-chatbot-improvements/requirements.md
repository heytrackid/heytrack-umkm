# AI Chatbot Improvements - Requirements

## Overview
Enhance the AI chatbot with session persistence, business context awareness, dynamic suggestions, and robust fallback handling.

## Goals
1. **Session Persistence**: Maintain conversation history across page reloads
2. **Business Context**: Load relevant business data for context-aware responses
3. **Dynamic Prompts**: Generate intelligent suggestions based on user state
4. **Fallback Handling**: Graceful degradation when AI services fail
5. **Performance**: Efficient data loading and caching

## User Stories

### Session Persistence
- As a user, I want my chat history to persist when I refresh the page
- As a user, I want to continue conversations across different sessions
- As a user, I want to clear my chat history when needed

### Business Context
- As a user, I want the AI to know about my recipes, ingredients, and orders
- As a user, I want relevant suggestions based on my current page/context
- As a user, I want the AI to reference my actual business data

### Dynamic Suggestions
- As a user, I want to see suggested questions relevant to my current view
- As a user, I want suggestions to update based on my business state
- As a user, I want quick access to common queries

### Fallback Handling
- As a user, I want helpful error messages when AI is unavailable
- As a user, I want to see cached responses when possible
- As a user, I want the app to remain functional without AI

## Technical Requirements

### Data Storage
- Store chat sessions in Supabase with user_id isolation
- Cache business context data with TTL
- Store user preferences for chat behavior

### API Design
- Context-aware endpoint that loads relevant business data
- Session management endpoints (create, list, delete)
- Streaming responses for better UX

### Frontend
- Optimistic UI updates for messages
- Loading states and skeleton screens
- Error boundaries for graceful failures

### Performance
- Lazy load chat component
- Cache business context (5-minute TTL)
- Debounce user input
- Limit message history (last 20 messages)

## Success Metrics
- Chat sessions persist across page reloads
- Context loading < 500ms
- AI response time < 3s (streaming)
- Fallback triggers < 1% of requests
- Zero data loss on session management
