npm run dev

# Check TypeScript errors
npm run type-check

# Run linter
npm run lint
```

### Browser Console Tests

After logging in, run this in browser console:

```javascript
// Quick auth verification
async function verifyAuth() {
  const supabase = createClient()
  const { data: { session } } = await supabase.auth.getSession()
  console.log('Session:', session)
  
  const ordersRes = await fetch('/api/orders')
  console.log('Orders API:', ordersRes.status)
  
  if (ordersRes.ok) {
    const orders = await ordersRes.json()
    console.log('Orders count:', orders.length)
    console.log('All have user_id:', orders.every(o => o.user_id))
  }
}

verifyAuth()
```

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Perform manual testing using AUTH_TESTING_GUIDE.md
   - Test with at least 2 different user accounts
   - Verify data isolation between users
   - Test on mobile devices

2. **Future Enhancements:**
   - Add automated E2E tests with Playwright or Cypress
   - Implement session timeout warnings
   - Add rate limiting for auth endpoints
   - Implement 2FA for enhanced security

3. **Monitoring:**
   - Monitor auth error rates in production
   - Track session duration metrics
   - Monitor API 401 response rates
   - Set up alerts for auth failures

---
