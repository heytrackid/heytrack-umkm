# Database Schema Audit and Migration Summary

## Task Completed: Database schema audit and migration

### What Was Done

1. **Added user_id columns** to all user-specific tables:
   - ✅ orders
   - ✅ bahan_baku (ingredients)
   - ✅ resep (recipes)
   - ✅ resep_item (recipe ingredients)
   - ✅ order_items
   - ✅ customers
   - ✅ financial_transactions
   - ✅ stock_ledger
   - ✅ bahan_baku_pembelian (ingredient purchases)
   - ✅ biaya_operasional (operational costs)
   - ✅ production_log
   - ✅ low_stock_alerts
   - ✅ hpp_snapshots (already had user_id)
   - ✅ hpp_alerts (already had user_id)

2. **Created performance indexes** on all user_id columns:
   - All 14 tables now have `idx_[table_name]_user_id` indexes
   - These indexes use B-tree for efficient lookups

3. **Enabled Row Level Security (RLS)** on all tables:
   - All 14 tables have RLS enabled (`rowsecurity = true`)

4. **Created RLS policies** based on `auth.uid() = user_id`:
   - SELECT policies: Users can view their own data
   - INSERT policies: Users can insert data with their user_id
   - UPDATE policies: Users can update their own data
   - DELETE policies: Users can delete their own data

### Migration File

Created: `supabase/migrations/20250123000000_add_user_id_for_auth.sql`

This migration:
- Adds user_id columns with foreign key references to `auth.users(id)`
- Creates indexes for query performance
- Enables RLS on all tables
- Drops old policies and creates new ones based on auth.uid()
- Adds documentation comments to columns

### Architecture Notes

The application now supports **dual authentication models**:

1. **Legacy model** (account_id-based):
   - Uses `public.accounts` table
   - JWT claims contain `account_id`
   - Policies check `auth.jwt() ->> 'account_id' = account_id`
   - Used by Telegram bot integration

2. **New model** (user_id-based):
   - Uses `auth.users` directly
   - Policies check `auth.uid() = user_id`
   - Used by web dashboard with Supabase Auth

Both models coexist, providing backward compatibility while enabling proper Supabase Auth integration.

### Verification Results

All verification queries passed:
- ✅ 14 tables have user_id columns
- ✅ 14 indexes created on user_id
- ✅ 14 tables have RLS enabled
- ✅ 56 RLS policies created (4 per table: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)

### Next Steps

The following tasks from the implementation plan can now proceed:

1. **Task 2**: Enable Row Level Security (RLS) policies ✅ (Already completed in this migration)
2. **Task 3**: Enhance auth utilities and hooks
3. **Task 4**: Update API routes with proper auth validation
4. **Task 5**: Update client-side components to handle auth properly

### Important Notes

- The user_id columns are nullable to maintain backward compatibility
- Existing data will have NULL user_id values until populated
- API routes need to be updated to set user_id when creating new records
- The application should gradually migrate from account_id to user_id for auth checks
