# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating all `console` statements (console.log, console.error, console.warn, console.info, console.debug) throughout the codebase to use the centralized `logger` utility from `src/lib/logger.ts`. This will provide consistent, structured logging with better control over log levels and formatting across development and production environments.

## Glossary

- **Console**: The native JavaScript console object used for logging (console.log, console.error, etc.)
- **Logger**: The centralized Pino-based logging utility located at `src/lib/logger.ts`
- **Context Logger**: A child logger created with specific context (e.g., apiLogger, dbLogger, authLogger)
- **Log Level**: The severity level of a log message (debug, info, warn, error)
- **Codebase**: All TypeScript and JavaScript files in the `src/` directory

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all logging to use a centralized logger utility, so that I have consistent log formatting and better control over log levels across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL replace all instances of `console.log()` with appropriate logger methods (`logger.info()` or `logger.debug()`)
2. THE System SHALL replace all instances of `console.error()` with `logger.error()`
3. THE System SHALL replace all instances of `console.warn()` with `logger.warn()`
4. THE System SHALL replace all instances of `console.info()` with `logger.info()`
5. THE System SHALL replace all instances of `console.debug()` with `logger.debug()`

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use context-specific loggers where appropriate, so that logs are properly categorized and easier to filter.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file is in the `src/app/api/` directory, THE System SHALL use `apiLogger` from `src/lib/logger.ts`
2. WHEN a file contains database operations, THE System SHALL use `dbLogger` from `src/lib/logger.ts`
3. WHEN a file is in the `src/app/auth/` directory, THE System SHALL use `authLogger` from `src/lib/logger.ts`
4. WHEN a file is related to cron jobs or scheduled tasks, THE System SHALL use `cronLogger` from `src/lib/logger.ts`
5. WHEN a file is related to automation features, THE System SHALL use `automationLogger` from `src/lib/logger.ts`
6. WHEN a file is a UI component, THE System SHALL use `uiLogger` from `src/lib/logger.ts`
7. WHEN no specific context applies, THE System SHALL use the default `logger` from `src/lib/logger.ts`

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper import statements for the logger, so that the code compiles without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL add the appropriate logger import statement at the top of each modified file
2. THE System SHALL use named imports for context-specific loggers (e.g., `import { apiLogger } from '@/lib/logger'`)
3. THE System SHALL use default import for the generic logger (e.g., `import logger from '@/lib/logger'`)
4. THE System SHALL remove any unused imports after migration
5. THE System SHALL maintain proper import ordering and formatting

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the logger to handle error objects properly, so that error details are captured in logs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN logging an error object with `console.error(message, error)`, THE System SHALL convert it to `logger.error({ err: error }, message)`
2. WHEN logging an error object with `console.error(error)`, THE System SHALL convert it to `logger.error({ err: error }, error.message || 'Error occurred')`
3. THE System SHALL preserve the error stack trace in the log output
4. THE System SHALL handle both Error instances and plain objects
5. THE System SHALL maintain the original error message context

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure no console statements remain in the codebase, so that all logging is centralized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL scan all TypeScript and JavaScript files in the `src/` directory
2. THE System SHALL identify all remaining `console` statements after migration
3. THE System SHALL report any files that still contain `console` statements
4. THE System SHALL exclude legitimate uses of console in development tools or scripts
5. THE System SHALL verify that all modified files compile without errors
