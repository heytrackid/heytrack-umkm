# Requirements Document

## Introduction

HeyTrack adalah aplikasi bakery management yang sudah memiliki beberapa optimasi performance, namun masih ada area yang perlu ditingkatkan. Berdasarkan audit yang telah dilakukan, terdapat 25+ komponen yang belum menggunakan React.memo, 40+ useEffect yang perlu diperbaiki dependensinya, dan 50+ console.log yang perlu diganti dengan proper logging. Fitur ini bertujuan untuk meningkatkan performance aplikasi dari skor Lighthouse 88 menjadi 95+, mengurangi re-renders hingga 70%, dan memastikan aplikasi production-ready.

## Glossary

- **React.memo**: Higher-order component React yang mencegah re-render komponen jika props tidak berubah
- **useEffect**: React hook untuk side effects yang memerlukan dependency array yang tepat
- **Debouncing**: Teknik untuk menunda eksekusi fungsi hingga periode waktu tertentu berlalu
- **Pino Logger**: High-performance logging library untuk Node.js
- **Re-render**: Proses React merender ulang komponen ketika state atau props berubah
- **Bundle Size**: Ukuran total file JavaScript yang dikirim ke browser
- **Lighthouse Score**: Metrik performance dari Google Chrome DevTools
- **FCP (First Contentful Paint)**: Waktu hingga konten pertama muncul di layar
- **TTI (Time to Interactive)**: Waktu hingga halaman fully interactive
- **TBT (Total Blocking Time)**: Total waktu dimana main thread diblokir

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: React.memo Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to optimize component re-renders using React.memo, so that the application performs better and uses less CPU resources

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a heavy component receives the same props, THE Application SHALL prevent unnecessary re-renders by using React.memo
2. WHERE a component performs expensive computations, THE Application SHALL wrap the component with React.memo to optimize performance
3. THE Application SHALL apply React.memo to at least 25 components including UI, automation, production, order, dashboard, and layout components
4. WHEN React.memo is applied, THE Application SHALL maintain the same functionality without breaking existing features
5. THE Application SHALL achieve at least 70% reduction in unnecessary re-renders for optimized components

### Requirement 2: Console.log Replacement

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to replace all console.log statements with proper logging, so that production logs are structured and don't expose sensitive information

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Application SHALL use Pino logger instead of console.log for all logging operations
2. WHEN logging in production, THE Application SHALL use appropriate log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
3. THE Application SHALL replace console.log in at least 50 locations across automation-engine, cron-jobs, services, and module components
4. THE Application SHALL include contextual data in structured format when logging
5. WHEN in development mode, THE Application SHALL display pretty-formatted logs for better readability

### Requirement 3: useEffect Dependencies Fix

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to fix all useEffect dependency arrays, so that there are no infinite loops or memory leaks

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a useEffect uses external functions or variables, THE Application SHALL include them in the dependency array
2. WHERE a function is used in useEffect, THE Application SHALL wrap it with useCallback to prevent infinite loops
3. THE Application SHALL fix useEffect dependencies in at least 40 locations including hooks and module components
4. WHEN useEffect has cleanup logic, THE Application SHALL ensure proper cleanup function is returned
5. THE Application SHALL pass ESLint exhaustive-deps rule without warnings

### Requirement 4: Search Input Debouncing

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth typing experience in search inputs, so that the application doesn't lag when I type quickly

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types in a search input, THE Application SHALL debounce the search operation with 300ms delay
2. THE Application SHALL apply debouncing to search inputs in customers, orders, ingredients, and categories pages
3. WHEN debouncing is applied, THE Application SHALL reduce API calls by at least 90%
4. THE Application SHALL maintain responsive UI during typing without blocking user input
5. WHEN search is debounced, THE Application SHALL show loading indicator to provide feedback

### Requirement 5: Performance Metrics Achievement

**User Story:** As a product owner, I want the application to achieve high performance scores, so that users have a fast and smooth experience

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Application SHALL achieve Lighthouse Performance score of at least 95
2. THE Application SHALL achieve First Contentful Paint (FCP) of less than 1.0 seconds
3. THE Application SHALL achieve Time to Interactive (TTI) of less than 2.5 seconds
4. THE Application SHALL achieve Total Blocking Time (TBT) of less than 150 milliseconds
5. THE Application SHALL reduce bundle size to less than 400KB

### Requirement 6: Memory Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to optimize memory usage, so that the application doesn't cause memory leaks or excessive memory consumption

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components unmount, THE Application SHALL properly cleanup all event listeners and subscriptions
2. THE Application SHALL reduce memory usage by at least 40% compared to current baseline
3. WHEN running for extended periods, THE Application SHALL not exhibit memory leaks
4. THE Application SHALL properly dispose of large objects and cached data when no longer needed
5. WHEN profiling memory, THE Application SHALL show stable memory usage pattern without continuous growth

### Requirement 7: Code Quality Standards

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase to follow performance best practices, so that future development maintains high quality

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Application SHALL pass all ESLint rules related to React hooks and performance
2. THE Application SHALL have zero console.log statements in production builds
3. THE Application SHALL document all performance optimizations in code comments
4. WHEN adding new components, THE Application SHALL follow established patterns for React.memo and useCallback
5. THE Application SHALL maintain TypeScript strict mode without type errors
