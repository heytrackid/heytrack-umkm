# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for eliminating all `any` types from the codebase and replacing them with proper TypeScript types. The goal is to improve type safety, code maintainability, and developer experience by ensuring all variables, parameters, and return types have explicit, meaningful types.

## Glossary

- **TypeScript System**: The TypeScript compiler and type checking system used in the project
- **Codebase**: All TypeScript and TSX files in the src/ directory
- **Type Safety**: The guarantee that variables and functions have well-defined types at compile time
- **Type Inference**: TypeScript's ability to automatically determine types without explicit annotations
- **Generic Types**: Parameterized types that allow reusable type-safe code

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Identify All Any Types

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify all instances of `any` types in the codebase, so that I can systematically replace them with proper types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the analysis is initiated, THE TypeScript System SHALL scan all TypeScript files in src/ directory
2. THE TypeScript System SHALL generate a report listing all files containing `any` types
3. THE TypeScript System SHALL categorize `any` types by usage context (function parameters, return types, variables, type assertions)
4. THE TypeScript System SHALL prioritize files based on number of `any` occurrences

### Requirement 2: Replace Function Parameter Any Types

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all function parameters with `any` type to have explicit types, so that function calls are type-safe.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a function parameter has type `any`, THE Codebase SHALL define an explicit interface or type for that parameter
2. THE Codebase SHALL use existing types from the types/ directory where applicable
3. WHERE a generic type is more appropriate, THE Codebase SHALL use TypeScript generics instead of `any`
4. THE TypeScript System SHALL compile without errors after type replacement

### Requirement 3: Replace Return Type Any

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all functions returning `any` to have explicit return types, so that consumers of these functions have type safety.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a function returns type `any`, THE Codebase SHALL define an explicit return type
2. THE Codebase SHALL use union types where multiple return types are possible
3. THE Codebase SHALL use generic return types where the return type depends on input parameters
4. THE TypeScript System SHALL validate return statements match declared return types

### Requirement 4: Replace Variable Any Types

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all variables with `any` type to have explicit types, so that variable usage is type-safe throughout the code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a variable is declared with type `any`, THE Codebase SHALL infer or explicitly declare the correct type
2. THE Codebase SHALL use type guards where runtime type checking is needed
3. WHERE state variables use `any`, THE Codebase SHALL define proper state interfaces
4. THE TypeScript System SHALL catch type mismatches at compile time

### Requirement 5: Replace Type Assertions with Any

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to eliminate `as any` type assertions, so that type safety is not bypassed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code uses `as any` type assertion, THE Codebase SHALL replace it with proper type casting or type guards
2. THE Codebase SHALL use type predicates for runtime type validation
3. WHERE external library types are incomplete, THE Codebase SHALL create proper type declarations
4. THE TypeScript System SHALL enforce type compatibility without `any` escape hatches

### Requirement 6: Create Missing Type Definitions

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper type definitions for all data structures, so that the codebase has comprehensive type coverage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a data structure lacks type definition, THE Codebase SHALL create an interface or type in the appropriate types/ file
2. THE Codebase SHALL organize types by domain (orders, recipes, inventory, etc.)
3. THE Codebase SHALL export types for reuse across modules
4. THE TypeScript System SHALL validate all usages of the new types

### Requirement 7: Validate Type Safety

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify that all type replacements maintain code functionality, so that refactoring doesn't introduce bugs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN types are replaced, THE TypeScript System SHALL compile without type errors
2. THE Codebase SHALL maintain existing functionality after type changes
3. WHERE type changes affect function signatures, THE Codebase SHALL update all call sites
4. THE TypeScript System SHALL report zero `any` types in strict mode

### Requirement 8: Update TypeScript Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want TypeScript configuration to prevent future `any` usage, so that type safety is maintained long-term.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE TypeScript System SHALL enable `noImplicitAny` compiler option
2. THE TypeScript System SHALL enable `strict` mode for maximum type safety
3. WHERE `any` is absolutely necessary, THE Codebase SHALL use explicit `// @ts-expect-error` comments with justification
4. THE TypeScript System SHALL fail compilation if new `any` types are introduced
