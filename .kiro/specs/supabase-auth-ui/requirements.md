# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a modern authentication system using Supabase Auth with shadcn UI components. The system will provide secure user authentication with a clean, neutral-colored interface that follows modern design principles.

## Glossary

- **Auth System**: The authentication system that handles user login, registration, and session management
- **Supabase Auth**: Supabase's built-in authentication service
- **shadcn UI**: A collection of re-usable UI components built with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS
- **Session**: An authenticated user's active connection to the application
- **User**: An individual who can authenticate and access the application

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to register for an account with my email and password, so that I can access the application

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the registration page, THE Auth System SHALL display a registration form with email and password fields
2. WHEN a user submits valid registration credentials, THE Auth System SHALL create a new user account in Supabase
3. WHEN a user submits invalid credentials, THE Auth System SHALL display clear validation error messages
4. WHEN registration is successful, THE Auth System SHALL redirect the user to the dashboard
5. THE Auth System SHALL enforce password requirements of minimum 8 characters

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an existing user, I want to log in with my email and password, so that I can access my account

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the login page, THE Auth System SHALL display a login form with email and password fields
2. WHEN a user submits valid login credentials, THE Auth System SHALL authenticate the user and create a session
3. WHEN a user submits invalid credentials, THE Auth System SHALL display an error message indicating authentication failure
4. WHEN login is successful, THE Auth System SHALL redirect the user to the dashboard
5. THE Auth System SHALL persist the user session across browser refreshes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user who forgot my password, I want to reset my password via email, so that I can regain access to my account

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the forgot password link, THE Auth System SHALL display a password reset form
2. WHEN a user submits their email address, THE Auth System SHALL send a password reset email via Supabase
3. WHEN a user clicks the reset link in the email, THE Auth System SHALL display a new password form
4. WHEN a user submits a new valid password, THE Auth System SHALL update the password in Supabase
5. THE Auth System SHALL display confirmation messages for each step of the password reset process

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want to log out of my account, so that I can secure my session when I'm done

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the logout button, THE Auth System SHALL terminate the current session
2. WHEN logout is complete, THE Auth System SHALL redirect the user to the login page
3. WHEN a user is logged out, THE Auth System SHALL clear all session data from the browser
4. THE Auth System SHALL prevent access to protected routes after logout

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the authentication pages to have a modern, clean design with neutral colors, so that the interface is pleasant and professional

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Auth System SHALL use shadcn UI components for all form elements
2. THE Auth System SHALL use a neutral color palette with shades of gray, white, and subtle accents
3. THE Auth System SHALL display forms in centered card layouts with proper spacing
4. THE Auth System SHALL provide smooth transitions and loading states during authentication
5. THE Auth System SHALL be fully responsive and work on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see clear feedback during authentication processes, so that I understand what is happening

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authentication action is in progress, THE Auth System SHALL display a loading indicator
2. WHEN an error occurs, THE Auth System SHALL display the error message in a toast notification
3. WHEN an action is successful, THE Auth System SHALL display a success message
4. THE Auth System SHALL disable form submission buttons during processing to prevent duplicate requests
5. THE Auth System SHALL provide inline validation feedback for form fields

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the authentication system to integrate seamlessly with the existing application, so that protected routes are secured

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Auth System SHALL provide middleware to protect routes that require authentication
2. WHEN an unauthenticated user attempts to access a protected route, THE Auth System SHALL redirect them to the login page
3. WHEN authentication state changes, THE Auth System SHALL update the UI accordingly
4. THE Auth System SHALL provide a callback route to handle Supabase authentication redirects
5. THE Auth System SHALL store user session data securely using Supabase's session management
