# Bundle Size Optimization Summary

## Date: January 2025

## Overview
This document summarizes the bundle size optimization work performed on the bakery-management application to improve loading performance and reduce JavaScript bundle sizes.

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Dynamic Imports for Heavy Components

#### A. `/inventory` Page - Main Inventory Route (KEPT)
**Status:** ✅ Optimized with SSR and dynamic imports

**Features:**
- Server-side rendering with data pre-fetching
- Dynamic imports for heavy components
- Pagination with 10/20/50/100 items per page
- Weighted average cost analysis
- Real-time stock alerts

**Bundle Size:** 376 kB First Load JS (includes SSR benefits)

#### B. `/inventory-enhanced` Page (REMOVED)
**Reason:** Redundant route - both pages used the same component
**Action:** Deleted to reduce maintenance overhead
**Benefit:** Cleaner codebase, less confusion for developers

### 2. Pagination Added to Inventory Table

**Feature:** Full-featured pagination for inventory table
**Implementation:** Client-side pagination with customizable page sizes

**Features:**
- Page size options: 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 items per page
- Previous/Next navigation buttons
- Current page indicator (e.g., "Halaman 1 dari 5")
- Item count display (e.g., "Menampilkan 1 - 10 dari 47 bahan")
- Auto-reset to page 1 when filters change

**Benefits:**
- ⚡ Improved performance for large datasets
- 👍 Better UX - users don't need to scroll through hundreds of items
- 📊 Efficient rendering - only shows current page items

#### C. Recharts Dynamic Loading
**Impact:** Recharts library (~50 kB) is now loaded on-demand only when charts are needed

**Files Optimized:**
1. `src/modules/charts/components/MiniChart.tsx`
   - Created `MiniChartCore.tsx` to isolate Recharts imports
   - Implemented dynamic import wrapper with loading state

2. `src/components/automation/inventory-analytics.tsx`
   - All Recharts components (LineChart, BarChart, PieChart, etc.) dynamically imported
   - Charts only load when analytics panel is viewed

3. `src/components/ai-chatbot/DataVisualization.tsx`
   - All Recharts visualization components dynamically imported
   - Reduces AI chatbot initial bundle size

### 2. Code Splitting Strategy

#### Pages Already Optimized (No Changes Needed)
- ✅ `/inventory` - Already using dynamic imports
- ✅ `/dashboard-optimized` - Already using lazy loading for charts
- ✅ `/finance` - Extensive dynamic imports for forms and components
- ✅ `/resep` - Lazy loading for RecipeForm and RecipeTable

#### Pages That Don't Need Optimization
- `/hpp` - Minimal bundle size, mostly UI components
- `/reports` - No heavy dependencies, uses simple progress bars

### 3. Code Cleanup - Removed Redundant Routes

**Action:** Removed `/inventory-enhanced` route
**Reason:** Duplicate functionality - used same component as `/inventory`
**Impact:** 
- ✅ Reduced codebase complexity
- ✅ Less confusion for developers
- ✅ Easier maintenance

### 4. Shared Bundle Optimization

**Before:** 106 kB shared chunks
**After:** 103 kB shared chunks
**Reduction:** ~3 kB (3% reduction)

The shared bundle contains:
- React core (~54.2 kB)
- Next.js runtime and utilities (~45.8 kB)
- Common UI components (~3.01 kB)

## Bundle Analysis Results

### Top Pages by Size (After Optimization)

| Route | Size | First Load JS | Status |
|-------|------|---------------|--------|
| `/inventory` | 12.9 kB | 375 kB | ✅ Optimized with dynamic imports |
| `/dashboard-optimized` | 9.44 kB | 368 kB | ✅ Already using lazy loading |
| `/hpp-enhanced` | 8.35 kB | 326 kB | ⚠️ Could benefit from dynamic imports |
| `/operational-costs` | 8.04 kB | 326 kB | ⚠️ Could benefit from dynamic imports |
| `/ingredients` | 7.68 kB | 366 kB | ✅ Good size |
| `/settings` | 7.49 kB | 371 kB | ✅ Good size |
| `/resep` | 7.26 kB | 371 kB | ✅ Optimized with lazy loading |

### Largest First Load JS Improvements

**Key Improvements:**
- ✅ Removed redundant `/inventory-enhanced` route
- ✅ Added pagination to `/inventory` table (better performance)
- ✅ All Recharts components: Lazy-loaded on demand (~50 kB saved on initial load)
- ✅ Shared chunks optimized from 106 kB → 103 kB

## Key Techniques Used

### 1. Next.js Dynamic Imports
```typescript
const Component = dynamic(() => import('./Component'), {
  loading: () => <LoadingSkeleton />,
  ssr: false // Disable server-side rendering for client-only components
})
```

### 2. React Suspense Boundaries
```typescript
<Suspense fallback={<LoadingSkeleton />}>
  <HeavyComponent />
</Suspense>
```

### 3. Component-Level Code Splitting
- Separated heavy library imports into dedicated "Core" components
- Wrapper components handle loading states and error boundaries

### 4. Tree-Shaking Optimizations
- Using specific imports from libraries (e.g., `import { format } from 'date-fns'`)
- Avoiding wildcard imports (e.g., `import * as DateFns from 'date-fns'`)

## Performance Metrics

### Bundle Size Metrics
- **Shared Chunks:** 103 kB (optimized)
- **Largest Page:** `/inventory` at 376 kB first load (includes SSR & charts)
- **Smallest Page:** `/` (home) at 103 kB first load
- **Average Page Size:** ~340 kB first load
- **Total Routes:** 53 pages (52 app routes + 1 not-found)

### Loading Performance
- Charts and heavy visualizations: Load on-demand
- Initial page render: Faster due to reduced initial JS payload
- User experience: Loading skeletons provide visual feedback

## Recommendations for Further Optimization

### High Priority
1. **Route-based code splitting for large pages**
   - `/hpp-enhanced` (8.35 kB) - Consider splitting forms and calculators
   - `/operational-costs` (8.04 kB) - Split cost table and form components

2. **Image optimization**
   - Ensure all images use Next.js `<Image>` component
   - Implement lazy loading for below-the-fold images

3. **Font optimization**
   - Use `next/font` for optimal font loading
   - Preload critical fonts

### Medium Priority
1. **Virtual scrolling for large tables**
   - Already using `@tanstack/react-virtual` in some places
   - Apply to all tables with >50 rows

2. **API response caching**
   - Implement more aggressive caching strategies
   - Use React Query stale-time appropriately

3. **Bundle analyzer for monitoring**
   - Run `pnpm build:analyze` regularly
   - Set up CI/CD bundle size monitoring

### Low Priority
1. **CSS optimization**
   - Consider CSS modules for critical styles
   - Purge unused Tailwind classes

2. **Third-party library audit**
   - Review if all dependencies are still needed
   - Look for lighter alternatives

## Testing Recommendations

### Performance Testing
```bash
# Build and analyze
pnpm build:analyze

# Test production build locally
pnpm build && pnpm start

# Lighthouse audit
# Run Lighthouse on key pages in production mode
```

### Visual Regression Testing
- Verify loading skeletons render correctly
- Ensure dynamic imports don't cause layout shifts
- Test error boundaries for failed dynamic imports

## Maintenance Notes

### When Adding New Features
1. **Always use dynamic imports for:**
   - Chart libraries (Recharts, Chart.js, etc.)
   - Heavy form libraries
   - Large visualization components
   - Modal dialogs with complex content

2. **Consider dynamic imports for:**
   - Components larger than 50 kB
   - Features used by <50% of users
   - Third-party widgets

3. **Avoid dynamic imports for:**
   - Core UI components (buttons, inputs, etc.)
   - Layout components
   - Navigation components
   - Small utilities (<10 kB)

### Monitoring Bundle Size
```bash
# Regular bundle analysis
pnpm build:analyze

# Check for large chunks
# Target: No single chunk > 200 kB
# Shared chunks: Keep < 120 kB
```
