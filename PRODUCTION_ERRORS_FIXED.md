# Production Errors - Fixed

## Issues Identified & Resolved

### 1. ✅ CSP Inline Style Violations

**Error:**
```
Refused to apply inline style because it violates CSP directive
```

**Root Cause:**
- Toaster component in `src/app/layout.tsx` had inline styles
- CSP policy blocks inline styles when nonce is present

**Fix Applied:**
- Removed inline styles from Toaster component
- Added CSS classes to `src/app/globals.css` instead
- Styles now comply with CSP nonce-based policy

**Files Changed:**
- `src/app/layout.tsx` - Removed inline styles from Toaster
- `src/app/globals.css` - Added `.toast-custom` styles

### 2. ✅ Auth Session Missing Errors

**Error:**
```
Auth session missing! AuthSessionMissingError
```

**Root Cause:**
- Middleware was calling `supabase.auth.getUser()` even when no auth cookies exist
- Supabase throws `AuthSessionMissingError` when cookies are missing/expired
- This is normal for unauthenticated requests but was being logged as errors

**Fix Applied:**
- Check for Supabase auth cookies BEFORE attempting auth check
- Only create Supabase client and call `getUser()` if cookies exist
- Silently handle auth errors without logging spam
- Auth errors no longer block requests

**Files Changed:**
- `src/middleware.ts` - Added cookie check before auth, improved error handling

### 3. ✅ jsdom/parse5 ESM Error

**Error:**
```
Failed to load external module jsdom: Error [ERR_REQUIRE_ESM]
```

**Root Cause:**
- `jsdom` was listed in `serverExternalPackages` in `next.config.ts`
- This caused jsdom to be bundled into production server
- jsdom is ESM-only and causes require() errors in CommonJS context
- jsdom is not actually used in the codebase

**Fix Applied:**
- Removed `jsdom` from `serverExternalPackages` in `next.config.ts`
- Verified no code imports or uses jsdom
- jsdom only needed for testing (already in devDependencies)

**Files Changed:**
- `next.config.ts` - Removed jsdom from serverExternalPackages

**Verification:**
```bash
grep -r "from.*jsdom\|require.*jsdom\|import.*jsdom" src/
# Result: No matches found - jsdom not used in source code
```

### 4. ✅ Missing 500 Error Page

**Error:**
```
Error: Failed to load static file for page: /500
ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '.next/server/pages/500.html'
```

**Root Cause:**
- No custom 500 error page existed
- Next.js was looking for it when errors occurred

**Fix Applied:**
- Created `src/app/500.tsx` with proper error UI
- Includes navigation back to dashboard
- Follows HeyTrack design system

**Files Created:**
- `src/app/500.tsx` - Custom 500 error page

---

## Verification Steps

### 1. Check CSP Compliance
```bash
# Build and check for CSP violations
pnpm build
# Look for: No CSP violation errors in console
```

### 2. Test Auth Flow
```bash
# Start dev server
pnpm dev
# Test: Login/logout should work without errors
# Check: No auth errors in terminal
```

### 3. Test API Routes
```bash
# Test dashboard stats endpoint
curl http://localhost:3000/api/dashboard/stats
# Should return: 401 Unauthorized (expected without auth)
# Should NOT return: jsdom error
```

### 4. Test Error Pages
```bash
# Navigate to non-existent page
curl http://localhost:3000/non-existent
# Should show: 404 page

# Trigger server error (if possible)
# Should show: 500 page (src/app/500.tsx)
```

## Production Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [x] CSP inline styles removed
- [x] Auth errors handled gracefully
- [x] jsdom/DOMPurify removed (already done)
- [x] 500 error page created
- [ ] Run `pnpm build` successfully
- [ ] Test all critical flows (login, orders, dashboard)
- [ ] Check browser console for CSP violations
- [ ] Verify no auth errors in logs
- [ ] Test error pages (404, 500)

---

## Monitoring in Production

### What to Watch:

1. **CSP Violations**
   - Check browser console for "Refused to..." errors
   - Monitor for inline style violations
   - Verify nonce is working correctly

2. **Auth Errors**
   - Should only see auth errors for actual auth failures
   - No "Auth session missing" spam in logs
   - Middleware should handle gracefully

3. **API Errors**
   - No jsdom/parse5 errors
   - All API routes return proper responses
   - Runtime config set to 'nodejs' for all routes

4. **Error Pages**
   - 404 page shows for not found
   - 500 page shows for server errors
   - Users can navigate back to app

## Summary

All production errors have been identified and fixed:

1. ✅ **CSP violations** - Removed inline styles from Toaster
2. ✅ **Auth errors** - Made middleware more resilient
3. ✅ **jsdom errors** - Already fixed (security middleware removed)
4. ✅ **Missing 500 page** - Created custom error page

The application should now run without these errors in production.
