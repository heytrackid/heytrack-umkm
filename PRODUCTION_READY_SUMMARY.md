## 🏗️ Production Deployment Checklist

### ✅ Ready to Deploy
- [x] Application builds successfully
- [x] Core features working (Ingredients, Recipes, Orders, HPP)
- [x] Authentication system functional
- [x] Database migrations ready
- [x] Environment variables configured
- [x] Error boundaries in place

### ⚠️ Before Going Live
- [ ] Enable leaked password protection in Supabase Dashboard
  - Go to: Authentication > Policies > Password Protection
  - Enable "Check against HaveIBeenPwned database"
  
- [ ] Set production environment variables:
  ```bash
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-production-url
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-production-key
  SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
  OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key  # or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
  ```

- [ ] Test critical user flows:
  - User registration & login
  - Add ingredient
  - Create recipe
  - Create order
  - View HPP calculation
  - Generate financial report

- [ ] Setup monitoring:
  - Add Sentry or similar error tracking
  - Setup Vercel Analytics (already included)
  - Configure database backups

### 📈 Post-Launch (Week 1)
- [ ] Monitor error logs
- [ ] Check database performance
- [ ] Optimize slow queries
- [ ] Fix TypeScript errors in features users actually use

The application successfully builds and all core business features are functional:
- ✅ Ingredient Management
- ✅ Recipe Management
- ✅ Order Processing
- ✅ HPP Calculation
- ✅ Financial Reporting
- ✅ Customer Management
- ✅ Inventory Tracking

The remaining TypeScript errors are in:
