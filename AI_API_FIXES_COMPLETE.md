## Date: October 1, 2025

## Overview
Successfully fixed all remaining issues with the AI + Supabase integration for the bakery management application. All 8 automated tests now pass with 100% success rate.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Inventory Optimization API (POST /api/ai/inventory)
**Problem:** 
- Error: "data.orders is not iterable"
- The `optimizeInventory` method was incorrectly delegating to `ProductionAIService.generateProductionSchedule()` which expected orders data, not ingredients data.

**Solution:**
- Created a dedicated `InventoryAIService` class (`src/lib/ai/services/InventoryAIService.ts`)
- Implemented comprehensive inventory optimization logic including:
  - Stock alert generation (critical/warning/low urgency levels)
  - Reorder recommendations with priority levels
  - Demand forecasting with seasonality and events
  - Cost optimization suggestions
  - Bulk ordering opportunities
- Updated `AIService` to use the new `InventoryAIService`

**Files Changed:**
- ‚ú® `src/lib/ai/services/InventoryAIService.ts` (NEW - 469 lines)
- üìù `src/lib/ai/index.ts` (updated imports and exports)

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Customer Insights API (GET /api/ai/customer-insights)
**Problem:**
- Error: "customers.reduce is not a function"
- The API was passing customer data in the wrong format to the AI service

**Solution:**
- Fixed data transformation to match `CustomerAIService` interface requirements
- Changed from passing `{ customers: customerData }` object to passing `customerData` array directly
- Properly mapped database fields to AI service expected fields:
  - `totalOrders` ‚Üí `orderCount`
  - `lastOrderDate` ‚Üí converted to Date object
  - `created_at` ‚Üí `firstOrderDate`

**Files Changed:**
- üìù `src/app/api/ai/customer-insights/route.ts`

---

### 3. ‚úÖ Pricing Analysis API POST (POST /api/ai/pricing)
**Problem:**
- 404 Error: "No recipes found in database"
- Service role was configured correctly but Supabase nested queries were failing due to RLS policies

**Solution:**
- Refactored `getRecipesData()` to fetch data in two separate queries instead of nested relationships
- First fetch recipes from `recipes` table
- Then fetch related data from `recipe_ingredients` table
- Manually join the data to create enriched recipe objects
- This approach bypasses RLS conflicts with nested queries

**Files Changed:**
- üìù `src/lib/ai/data-fetcher.ts` (refactored `getRecipesData` method)

**Root Cause:**
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies on both `recipes` and `recipe_ingredients` tables were causing issues with nested Supabase queries
- Service role should bypass RLS, but nested relationship queries had conflicts
- Separating queries resolved the issue
