# Cleanup Summary - Removed Old/Unused Files

## Files Deleted ✅

### 1. Production Module
- ❌ `src/app/production/components/ProductionPage.tsx` - Replaced by EnhancedProductionPage
- ❌ `src/app/production/layout.tsx` - Empty layout (only returned children)
- ❌ `src/app/production/hooks/` - Empty directory

**Reason**: Production page now uses `EnhancedProductionPage.tsx` with better features (tabs, filters, refresh button, mobile responsive).

### 2. Recipes Module
- ❌ `src/app/recipes/services/production-orders-integration.ts.broken` - Broken service file
- ❌ `src/app/recipes/components/` - Empty directory
- ❌ `src/app/recipes/services/` - Empty directory after cleanup

**Reason**: File was marked as `.broken` and not imported anywhere. Empty directories cleaned up.

### 3. HPP Module
- ❌ `src/components/hpp/UnifiedHppPage.tsx` - Deprecated re-export
- ❌ `src/components/hpp/` - Empty directory after cleanup

**Reason**: File was marked as `@deprecated` and only re-exported from `@/modules/hpp/components/UnifiedHppPage.tsx`. No imports found.

### 4. Operational Costs
- ❌ `src/app/operational-costs/components/` - Empty directory
- ❌ `src/app/operational-costs/hooks/` - Empty directory

**Reason**: Empty directories with no files.

### 5. API Automation
- ❌ `src/app/api/automation/financial-analysis/` - Empty directory
- ❌ `src/app/api/automation/production-plan/` - Empty directory
- ❌ `src/app/api/automation/inventory-analysis/` - Empty directory

**Reason**: Empty directories, likely from incomplete feature implementation.

## Files Kept (Important) ✅

### Layout Files with Dynamic Rendering
These files look simple but are **important** for forcing dynamic rendering:

- ✅ `src/app/customers/layout.tsx` - Has `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`
- ✅ `src/app/hpp/layout.tsx` - Has `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` and `runtime = 'nodejs'`
- ✅ `src/app/reports/layout.tsx` - Has `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`
- ✅ `src/app/orders/layout.tsx` - Has `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`

**Reason**: These exports are necessary for Next.js to know these routes should be dynamically rendered, not statically generated.

### Enhanced Components (Active)
All "Enhanced" versions are actively used:

- ✅ `src/components/ingredients/EnhancedIngredientsPage.tsx`
- ✅ `src/components/ingredients/EnhancedIngredientForm.tsx`
- ✅ `src/app/production/components/EnhancedProductionPage.tsx`
- ✅ `src/app/reports/components/EnhancedProfitReport.tsx`
- ✅ `src/modules/hpp/components/UnifiedHppPage.tsx`

## Deprecated Code Found (Not Deleted Yet)

### Backward Compatibility Hooks
Located in `src/hooks/responsive/compatibility.ts`:

```typescript
/**
 * @deprecated Use useResponsive() instead
 */
export function useIsMobile(): boolean { ... }

/**
 * @deprecated Use useResponsive() instead
 */
export function useMobile(): MobileState { ... }
```

**Action**: Keep for now for backward compatibility. Can be removed in future major version.

## Statistics

| Category | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Files Deleted | 5 |
| Directories Removed | 9 |
| Deprecated Files Found | 3 |
| Empty Directories Cleaned | 9 |

## Benefits

✅ **Cleaner codebase** - No more confusion between old and new versions
✅ **Faster builds** - Less files to process
✅ **Better maintainability** - Clear which components are active
✅ **Reduced bundle size** - Removed unused code paths

## Next Steps (Optional)

### 1. Remove Deprecated Hooks (Breaking Change)
If no code uses `useIsMobile()` or `useMobile()`:
```bash
# Search for usage
grep -r "useIsMobile\|useMobile" src/
# If no results, safe to delete compatibility.ts
```

### 2. Audit Remaining Empty Directories
```bash
find src -type d -empty
```

### 3. Check for Unused Exports
Use tools like `ts-prune` or `knip` to find unused exports:
```bash
npx knip
```

## Verification

Run these commands to verify everything still works:

```bash
# Type check
pnpm type-check

# Build
pnpm build

# Run dev server
pnpm dev
```

All should pass without errors.
