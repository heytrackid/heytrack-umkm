## ⚠️ PARTIAL CRUD - By Design

These routes have limited methods because they serve specific purposes:

### 1. Financial Records (`/api/financial/records`)
- ✅ GET `/api/financial/records` - List financial records
- ✅ POST `/api/financial/records` - Create manual entry
- ❌ PUT - Not needed (records are immutable)
- ❌ DELETE - Not needed (use soft delete or adjustment entries)

**Reason:** Financial records should be immutable for audit trail.

### 2. HPP Calculations (`/api/hpp/calculations`)
- ✅ GET `/api/hpp/calculations` - List HPP calculations
- ✅ POST `/api/hpp/calculations` - Create HPP calculation
- ❌ PUT - Not needed (calculations are snapshots)
- ❌ DELETE - Not needed (historical data)

**Reason:** HPP calculations are historical snapshots.

### 3. Notifications (`/api/notifications`)
- ✅ GET `/api/notifications` - List notifications
- ✅ PATCH `/api/notifications/[id]` - Mark as read
- ❌ POST - System-generated only
- ❌ PUT - Not needed
- ❌ DELETE - Not needed (use soft delete)

**Reason:** Notifications are system-generated.

## 📊 Statistics

| Category | Count | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Full CRUD Resources | 10 | Complete GET/POST/PUT/DELETE |
| Partial CRUD (By Design) | 3 | Limited methods intentionally |
| Special Purpose | 20+ | Single-purpose endpoints |
| **Total API Routes** | **33+** | All properly secured |

---

## ✅ Security Checklist (All Routes)

All API routes implement:
- ✅ Authentication check (`supabase.auth.getUser()`)
- ✅ RLS enforcement (`.eq('user_id', user.id)`)
- ✅ Input validation (Zod schemas)
- ✅ Error handling (try-catch with apiLogger)
- ✅ Proper HTTP status codes
- ✅ Security middleware (where applicable)

---

## 🎯 Recommendations

### 1. Add Missing [id] Routes
Consider adding individual resource routes for:
- ❌ `/api/operational-costs/[id]` - Currently uses query param
- ❌ `/api/ingredient-purchases/[id]` - Currently uses query param

### 2. Standardize PATCH vs PUT
- Most routes use PUT for updates
- Some use PATCH (notifications, production batches, order status)
- **Recommendation:** Use PUT for full updates, PATCH for partial

### 3. Add Bulk Operations
Consider adding bulk endpoints for:
- `/api/recipes/bulk-delete`
- `/api/orders/bulk-update-status`
- `/api/ingredients/bulk-import`

### 4. Add Soft Delete Support
For audit trail, consider soft delete for:
- Customers (set `is_active = false`)
- Recipes (set `status = 'archived'`)
- Orders (set `status = 'cancelled'`)

---

## 🔍 Testing Checklist

For each CRUD endpoint, test:
- [ ] GET - Returns data for authenticated user only
- [ ] POST - Creates resource with user_id
- [ ] PUT - Updates only user's own resources
- [ ] DELETE - Deletes only user's own resources
- [ ] 401 - Returns unauthorized without auth
- [ ] 404 - Returns not found for non-existent resources
- [ ] 400 - Returns bad request for invalid data
- [ ] 409 - Returns conflict for constraint violations
