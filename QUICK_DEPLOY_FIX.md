# Quick Deploy Fix - Production Errors

## What Was Fixed

1. **AuthSessionMissingError** - Added cookie check before auth in middleware
2. **jsdom ESM Error** - Removed jsdom from serverExternalPackages
3. **CSP Inline Style Violations** - Removed from Toaster component
4. **Missing 500 Page** - Created custom error page

## Deploy Now

```bash
# 1. Verify build works
pnpm build

# 2. Test locally
pnpm start

# 3. Deploy to Vercel
git add .
git commit -m "fix: resolve production CSP violations and auth errors"
git push origin main
```

## What Changed

### Files Modified:
- `src/app/layout.tsx` - Removed inline styles from Toaster
- `src/app/globals.css` - Added toast CSS classes
- `src/middleware.ts` - Improved auth error handling

### Files Created:
- `src/app/500.tsx` - Custom 500 error page
- `PRODUCTION_ERRORS_FIXED.md` - Full documentation

## Expected Results

After deployment:

✅ No CSP violation errors in browser console  
✅ No "Auth session missing" spam in logs  
✅ No jsdom/parse5 errors  
✅ Custom 500 page shows on server errors  
✅ Toasts still work (now with CSS classes)  

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:

```bash
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

Then investigate specific issue.

## Monitoring

Check these after deployment:

1. Browser console - No CSP errors
2. Vercel logs - No auth error spam
3. Test toast notifications - Should work
4. Test error pages - 404 and 500 should show

**Ready to deploy!** All fixes are backward compatible and safe.
